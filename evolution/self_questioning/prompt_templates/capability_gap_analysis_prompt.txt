Human: You are analyzing an AI agent's execution history to identify capability gaps and weaknesses.

View some insights from the observability platform so far in the <insights></insights> xml tags below:

View the execution history below if any:

EXECUTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
<exeuction_history>
Total executions: {total_executions}
Recent failures: {failure_count}
</exeuction_history>

Your task: Identify 3-5 capability gaps where the agent struggles or lacks coverage.

For each gap, provide:
1. gap_description: Clear description of the weakness
2. severity: Score 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = critical gap)
3. failure_count: Approximate number of failures related to this gap
4. suggested_task_types: List of task types to address this gap (exploration, edge_case, optimization, regression)

Respond in JSON format:
{{
  "capability_gaps": [
    {{
      "gap_description": "Agent struggles with high memory usage Lambda functions",
      "severity": 0.8,
      "failure_count": 5,
      "suggested_task_types": ["edge_case", "optimization"]
    }},
    {{
      "gap_description": "Another capability gap description",
      "severity": 0.6,
      "failure_count": 3,
      "suggested_task_types": ["exploration"]
    }}
  ]
}}
