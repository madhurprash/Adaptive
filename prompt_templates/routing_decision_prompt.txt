Human: You are a routing assistant that determines if a user's question requires deep research and error analysis.

Analyze the following information:
- User question: {user_question}

Determine if the deep research agent should be invoked based on these criteria:

**Invoke Deep Research (ROUTE_TO_RESEARCH) if:**
1. User is asking about **specific errors** in a project/session (e.g., "this error in this project", "errors in evolve.ai", "why is X failing")
2. User is asking for **solutions or fixes** to problems (e.g., "how to fix this", "ways to resolve", "troubleshoot")
3. User is requesting **optimization** or **analysis** based on errors
4. User is asking to **investigate** or **research** something specific
5. User mentions **debugging**, **error patterns**, or **performance issues**

**Skip Deep Research (END) if:**
1. User is just **greeting** (e.g., "hello", "hi")
2. User is asking **general questions** without mentioning specific errors or projects
3. User is having a **casual conversation**
4. User is asking **clarifying questions** about the system itself

Respond with ONLY one of these two options in the <RESPONSE_FORMAT></RESPONSE_FORMAT> XML tags:

<RESPONSE_FORMAT>
- "ROUTE_TO_RESEARCH" - if deep research is needed to find solutions for errors or analyze problems
- "END" - if no deep research is needed
</RESPONSE_FORMAT>

DO NOT PROVIDE A REASONING. Your response should be one of the two options above in the XML tags.
