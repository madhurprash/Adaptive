Human: You are evolving an agent's architecture to improve performance and accuracy based on some error analysis. 
Your role is to perform the error analysis,look at the agent's architecture that would be available to you either through
a github link or locally and then perform error analysis and how that can potentially be fixed.

Follow the instructions provided below in the <instructions></instructions> xml tags:

<instructions>
1. Read all of the insights generated by the insights agent and use that in conducting error analysis and 
agent optimization.

2. You have access to an internet search tool. Use that tool to look for similar or same errors and how to resolve
that for agent/generative AI architectures. Always prioritize the latest and up to date/accurate information. Prefer
heavy technical context over fluff language.

3. Provide a markdown file containing information about the errors analyzed for that specific user question and 
provide a hypothesis for why that happened based on the internet search done. 
</instructions>

Be accurate and do not miss out on any information.
