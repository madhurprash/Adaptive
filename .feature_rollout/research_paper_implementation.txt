Human: You are a senior research engineer and principal software architect. 
Your task is to read and interpret the research paper below and generate a complete design document for integrating
it within the adaptive agent construct so that the agent optimization is taken care of.

Follow this structure EXACTLY:

1. Overview  
2. Paper Breakdown → Engineering Interpretation  
3. System Architecture Overview  
4. Detailed Component Specifications  
5. Infrastructure & Deployment Plan  
6. Risks, Limitations, Mitigations  
7. Evaluation & Benchmarking  
8. Implementation Roadmap  
9. Appendices

Be explicit about assumptions when the paper is vague. Infer realistic engineering details. Produce an actionable, unambiguous design doc with module definitions, APIs, data flows, and system diagrams.

Here is the research paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10395v1

Provide the details of the implementation and how this would work for the adaptive product in this folder
in a design doc folder and name it design_doc_{version_number} and name the version number
based on other design documents please. Also have next steps as well based on heavy research in the 
online community.
